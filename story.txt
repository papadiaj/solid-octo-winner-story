There once was a boy named Timmy, who lived with his mom in a forest. They struggled for food until one day a king 
rode by thier house, and was set on by wolves. They king fought bravely, but as he was being over powered Timmy
 came with a stick raised high and drove the wolves away.

The king thanked Timmy and brought him to his palace in the mountains. Timmy came under the apprenticeship of the
king's magician, and soon began to learn many magical and pseudoscientific practices.
